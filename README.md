# Record linkage performance experiments

This repository contains a several python notebooks to compare the performance of record linkage algorithms. The experiments may use the [Python Record Linkage Toolkit](https://github.com/J535D165/recordlinkage) ([documentation](https://github.com/J535D165/recordlinkage)). The experiments cover indexing, comparing and classifcation algorithms.
